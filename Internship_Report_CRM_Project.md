This full-stack application features a React frontend with Vite build tool and a Node.js/Express backend with MySQL database. The project demonstrates proficiency in full-stack development, database design, API development, testing, and deployment using Docker.

## Project Overview

### Project Title
**Full-Stack CRM System with Role-Based Access Control and AI Integration**

### Duration
**From July 1st to July 31th**

### Technologies Used
- **Frontend**: React 19.1.0, Vite, Bootstrap 5.3.7, React Router DOM 7.6.3
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js, MySQL 8.0
- **Authentication**: JWT (JSON Web Tokens), bcryptjs
- **Testing**: Jest, React Testing Library
- **Deployment**: Docker, Docker Compose
- **Additional**: ECharts for analytics, PDFKit for invoice generation, AI integration

## Technical Architecture

### System Architecture
The CRM system follows a modern three-tier architecture:

1. **Presentation Layer**: React-based Single Page Application (SPA)
2. **Application Layer**: Node.js/Express REST API
3. **Data Layer**: MySQL relational database

### Database Design
The system implements a comprehensive database schema with the following key entities:

- **Users & Authentication**: `userauth`, `userdetails`, `role`, `permissions`, `roleuser`, `rolepermissions`
- **Core CRM Entities**: `contacts`, `leads`, `deals`, `invoices`
- **Supporting Features**: `notifications`, `reports`, `settings`

The database design follows normalization principles and implements proper foreign key relationships for data integrity.

### API Design
The backend implements a RESTful API with the following endpoints:

- **Authentication**: `/api/auth/*` - Login, signup, token management
- **User Management**: `/api/users/*` - CRUD operations for users
- **CRM Operations**: 
  - `/api/contacts/*` - Contact management
  - `/api/leads/*` - Lead management  
  - `/api/deals/*` - Deal management
  - `/api/invoices/*` - Invoice management
- **Analytics**: `/api/reports/*` - Reporting and analytics
- **Settings**: `/settings/*` - Application configuration
- **AI Integration**: `/api/ai-leads/*` - AI-powered lead generation
